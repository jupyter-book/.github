## Community-driven tools for technical communication

📖 Jupyter Book is a [community
developed](https://next.jupyterbook.org/about/community/) project that
empowers you to create documents and knowledge bases that are
reusable, reproducible, and interactive.

Jupyter Book, the organization, develops [Jupyter
Book](https://next.jupyterbook.org/): user-friendly software for
rapidly building rich, interlinked books and websites from [MyST
Markdown](https://next.jupyterbook.org/tutorial/mystmd/) content.

The organization also supports numerous other pieces of software
around which Jupyter Book is built, most notably the [MyST Document
Engine](https://mystmd.org/).

> [!TIP]
> Jupyter Book is distribution of the MyST Document Engine that
> includes configuration, plugins, and styles.
> This is version 2 of Jupyter Book.
> Version 1 was built around Sphinx.
